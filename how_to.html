		  <h2>About this guide</h2>
		  <article>
		    This guide was designed to inform the reader about JavaScript functions and how those functions can be used to create classes within your 
			JavaScript code.  Creating classes in JavaScript will allow for greater flexibility, maintainability and scalability in your project.

		    JavaScript is a computer programming language used as a client side scripting language.  JavaScript will interact with the user without the 
			need to send and retrieve information to and from the server.  JavaScript is very popular because it is very powerful and useful in web
			development.  JavaScript can dynamically add and change html elements on a html page.

		  <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
		  <article>
		    Functions are a very useful tool in computer programming.  They allow the programmer to encapsulate a task into a block of code that can be called multiple times 
			throughout the program.

		  <h2>JavaScript Functions as Classes</h2>
		  <article>
		    JavaScript is an object-oriented language.  Which means JavaScript can be organized using object rather than a series of instructions and procedures.  An object is a
			grouping of related data that can be similar to real world objects.  Usually an object will have variables and methods which manipulate those variables.<br>
			<br>
			Below is an example to create a basic class and object.  You first want to create a function with its data members defined.  Then create a variable and set
			it equal to an instance of the function you just created by using the keyword new.  The "this" keyword refers to the instance of the object the function belongs to.
			Whatever object called the function is what "this" refers to.  The variables "number1" and "number2" are initialised to the values shown but can be updated later on.
			<pre>   
	//Create the class
	function myFunction() {
		this.number1 = 5;
		this.number2 = 7;
		this.addNumbers = function() {
			return this.number1 + this.number2;
		}
	}
			
			
	//Create an instance of the class
	var classInstance = new myFunction();
			
			</pre>
			You can use the prototype object to add member functions at runtime.  Every object in JavaScript has a prototype and all objects inherit from their prototype.  This is a great 
			feature JavaScript provides.  
			
			Why use prototype property? 
			<pre>
			function car(name) {
				this.name = name;
				this.price = 0;
				this.set_price = function(price) {
					this.price = price;
				}
			}

			</pre>
			In the example above the object car has two properties, name and price, and a set price method that will change the price.  This set price method will be created 
			every time a new car is created which may or may not be what you want.  Creating the set name method every time will increase the overhead of your program.  
			Instead you can add the set price method to the prototype so it will not have to be recreated every time a new car is made.  This will make object creation 
			faster and improve the performance of your web page.
			
			<pre>
			function car(name) {
				this.name = name;
				this.price = 0;
			}
			
			car.prototype.set_price = function(price) {
				this.price = price;
			}

			</pre>
			public and private member functions.
			Public data members can be access directly using the dot operator.  When you create a data member using the this keyword that makes the data member public.
			Public data members are specific to each object instance.
			
			<pre>
			function Person () {
				this.name = 'null';
			}
			
			var customer = new Person();
			customer.name = 'Larry';
			</pre>
			Data members can also be accessed using square brackets and quotes.  This is useful when you have key value pairs.
			<pre>
			function Person () {
				this.name = 'null';
			}
			
			var customer = new Person();

			var key = "name";
			customer[key];
			
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			Private data members.
			</pre>
			
			static members
			<pre>
			Static member variables are shared by all instances of the class.  There is only one copy of the static variable that is referenced by the class instances.  
			
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			classInstance.prototype.
			</pre>
			
			JavaScript does not use the classical inheritance model instead uses a prototyped inheritance model.  This will allow you to create new objects by coping other objects 
			and adding new data and method.
			
			pros - modular easier to develop and colaborate with team members. they can use your classes for there development. reuse class.
			
			prototype property - during runtime, object inheritance.
			childClass.prototype = new ParentClass();
			access those methods - 
				var instance1 = new Childclass();
				instance1.parentclass;
				
			override method
				ChildClass.prototype.parentmethod1 = function parentmethod1(){}
				
			
			
			
			public members
			function Employee(firstname, lastname) {
				//public fields
				this.firstname = firstname;
				this.lastname = lastname;
				
				//private fields
				var privateFullName;
				
				//private function
				inside constructor function
				var privategetFullName = function() {
					
				}
				
			}
			private members
